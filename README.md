# TowerResearchCapital_Practice
Based on an online thread, I've decided to work on projects from Interview questions from Tower Research Capital

Some of the questions I'll be working on:

1) Coding an RNN from scratch (No Pytorch)
2) Manual BPTT
3) Beam search w/ backtracking
4) Shell Scripting Questions
5) Reconstruct gradients for custom loss function

If anyone has other reccomendations please let me know :)
